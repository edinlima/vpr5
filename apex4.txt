General Options:
	The circuit will be placed and routed.

Placer Options:
	Placement algorithm is path_timing_driven
	Tradeoff between bounding box and critical path: 0.5
	Lower bound assumes block distance: 1
	Recomputing criticalities every 1 temperature changes
	Inner loop computes criticalities every move_lim/0 moves
	Exponent starting value used in timing-driven cost function is 1
	Exponent final value used in timing-driven cost function is 8
	Automatic annealing schedule selected.
	Number of moves in the inner loop is (num_blocks)^4/3 * 10
	Placement cost type is linear congestion.
	Placement will be performed once.
	Placement channel width factor = 100.
	Exponent used in placement cost: 1
	Initial random seed: 1

Routing Options:
	Combined GLOBAL + DETAILED routing will be performed.
	Router algorithm:  timing driven.
	The router will try at most 30 iterations.
	Routings can go at most 3 channels outside their bounding box.
	Cost of a bend (bend_cost) is 0.
	First iteration sharing penalty factor (first_iter_pres_fac): 0.5
	Initial (2nd iter.) sharing penalty factor (initial_pres_fac): 0.5
	Sharing penalty growth factor (pres_fac_mult): 2
	Accumulated sharing penalty factor (acc_fac): 1
	Base_cost_type:  delay normalized.
	Search aggressiveness factor (astar_fac): 1.2
	Maximum sink criticality (max_criticality): 0.99
	Exponent for criticality computation (criticality_exp): 1
	Router will find the minimum number of tracks required to route.
