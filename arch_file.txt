# 4-input LUT.  LUT inputs first, then output, then clock.
# Each input pin appears on one side, while the output is
# on the bottom and right sides.  Note that the 4 LUT inputs are
# all made logically-equivalent by declaring them to be the same
# class.

# Class 0 is LUT inputs, class 1 is the output, class 2 is the clock.
