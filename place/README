The files in this archive define the placement generated by VPR with
its default parameters for the 20 largest MCNC LGSynth93 benchmarks.
The number of pads that can fit in a row or column is set to 2, and the 
FPGA array size is the smallest square array that can fit the circuit.
Note that two of the circuits are pad-limited.  For details on the .place
file format, see the VPR User's Manual.
